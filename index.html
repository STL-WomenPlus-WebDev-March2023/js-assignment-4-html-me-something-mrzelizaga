   <img src = "https://i.pinimg.com/564x/f8/f6/66/f8f666b2277cc981d4742efce4e351c0.jpg">

   <p>&lt;i&gt;For the Cake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      2 cups all-purpose flour&lt;br&gt;
      4 teaspoons baking powder&lt;br&gt;
      1/2 teaspoon salt&lt;br&gt;
      1 cup granulated sugar&lt;br&gt;
      1 teaspoon vanilla extract&lt;br&gt;
      1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold&lt;br&gt;
      1 cup milk&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;For The Topping&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      1 cup heavy whipping&lt;br&gt;
      1 teaspoon vanilla extract&lt;br&gt;
      1 pint fresh strawberries, rinsed and cut into thin slices&lt;br&gt;
      2 Tablespoons granulated sugar&lt;br&gt;</p>
</p>
   <h3>Preparation</h3>
      <p>
      1. Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a 8 inch round pan with parchment paper on the bottom and either spray the sides with cookie spray or butter and flour them. Set aside. <br>
      2. In a large mixing bowl combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt and mix to combine.<br>
      3. Cut the cold butter into small pieces and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture starts to clump together. <br>
      4. Make a well in the center and add the milk and vanilla extract. Mix until just combined. <br>
      5. Transfer the batter to your prepared pan, using a rubber spatula to spread the batter into an even layer. If desired, top with coarse sugar.<br>
      6. Bake for 35 minutes or until a knife inserted into the middle comes out mostly clean. Transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool for 15 minutes before running a butter knife along the edge of the cake and turning it out of the pan. Allow to cool completely before topping.<br>
      7. While the cake cools, make the whipped cream and prep the strawberries. Place the sliced strawberries in a medium sized bowl with the sugar and stir to combine. Cover and set aside.<br>
      8. Beat the heavy cream in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until soft peaks form and the whipped cream holds its shape.
      When ready to serve, spoon the whipped cream over the top of the cake and top with strawberries!

   <img src = "https://i.pinimg.com/564x/89/8a/86/898a86d1f2d707cd374551dd56b7113c.jpg">

   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <p>
       2 cups all-purpose flour <br>
       1/4 cup granulated sugar <br>
       1/2 teaspoon salt <br>
       6 tablespoons salted butter, cold <br>
       1/2 cup buttermilk <br>
       3/4 cup rhubarb, chopped <br>
       4 ounces raspberries, fresh but frozen so they do not squish when you fold them into the dough <br>
       1/2 cup white chocolate chips, melted
      <br></p>

   <h3>Preparation</h3>
      <p>
      1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, and salt. Work the butter in using a pastry cutter until it becomes the size of small peas. Stir in the buttermilk until everything begins to comes together, but do not over mix.<br>
      2. Place the dough onto a well-floured surface and carefully work in rhubarb and raspberries. Try to mix as little as possible. Pat dough into a 9 inch circle (about 1″ thick). Cut the scones with a sharp knife into 8 equal slices.<br>
      3. Place scones on a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving an inch between each scone. Place into the freezer for 15 minutes.<br>
      4. While freezing, preheat the oven to 425°F.<br>
      5. Once chilled, lightly brush the tops of the scones with heavy cream, then bake for 20 minutes, until they’re light golden brown.<br>
      6. Once out of the oven, drizzle with melted white chocolate!<br>

      <img src = "https://i.pinimg.com/564x/3b/5e/8e/3b5e8e0377a4ed4fbd3ee27deceb724d.jpg">
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <p><i>For The Pie Crust</i><br>
         1 1/4 cups all purpose flour<br>
         1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br>
         1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
         1/2 cup unsalted butter cold, cut into cubes<br>
         2 – 3 tablespoons ice cold vodka or water<br>
         1 egg, for egg wash<br>
         coarse sugar<br><br>

         <i>For The Peach Filling</i><br>
         3 large peaches, pitted and cut into thin slices<br>
         1/3 cup granulated sugar<br>
         1 Tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces<br>
         1 Tablespoon all purpose flour<br>
         Pinch of salt<br>
            
          
      <h3>Preparation</h3>
         <p>
            1. Place the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor. Add the cold butter to the food 
            processor and pulse until the mixture resembles wet sand and no large chunks of butter remain.<br>
            2. Add in the vodka (or water), one tablespoon at a time. If your dough has come together, don’t add any more 
            vodka. You want just enough to bind the dough into a ball.<br>
            3.Turn the dough out of the food processor and form into a flat oval disk and wrap in plastic wrap. 
            Place in fridge for at least 30 minutes, but up to 3 days.<br>
            4. Once your dough has chilled, preheat the oven to 375°F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. 
            Set aside.<br>
            5. Sprinkle a work surface with flour. Roll your dough out into a 12-inch circle. Place dough onto prepared
            baking tray. Place a 9-inch cake pan in the center of the circle and press down ever so slightly. This will create an indentation to show exactly how far out to place your filling!<br>
            6.In a large bowl, combine the peach slices, sugar, flour, and salt. Toss together to evenly coat. <br>
            7. Place the peach mixture in the center of the pie crust in an even layer. Top with the small pieces of butter. 
            Lift the edges of the pie dough in towards the center, folding every 3-4 inches as you go around.<br>
            8. Mix  the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush over crust. Top with coarse sugar if desired. Bake for 30-40 
            minutes, until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown. <br>  
         <br>

      1 cup granulated sugar<br>
      1 egg, room temperature<br>
